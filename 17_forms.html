    <!-- <label>:
        We should have some sort of label with the input we choose.
        Makes your forms easier to use.
        The "for" tag should have the same value as the id we want it to be connected to.
    <id>: 
        Connection from a label to an input is made using "id" tag. It should be unique for every input.
        It should be short and simple
        We set the exact same value as that of the id for the "for" attribute. 
        It tells you for what input, the label is being used.
