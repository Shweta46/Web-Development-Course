/* 
Positions-

1. Static-
This is the default.

2. Relative-
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements thus the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if the position were static.

3. Absolute-
The element is removed from the normal document flow and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (can be body, section, div), if any, otherwise, it is place relative to the intial containing block.
Its final position depends on the value of top, bottom, left, and right.

4. Fixed-
It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none, in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block.

5. Sticky-
