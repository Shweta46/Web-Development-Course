    <h1>The Queen's Gambit</h1>This is something after heading.
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Queen's Gambit is a 2020 American coming-of-age <b>period drama</b> streaming television miniseries based on
        the 1983 novel of the same name by Walter Tevis. The title refers to the "Queen's Gambit", a chess opening. The
        series was written and directed by <b>Scott Frank</b>, who created it with Allan Scott, who owns the rights to
        the book. Beginning in the mid-1950s and proceeding into the 1960s, the story follows the life of Beth Harmon
        (Anya Taylor-Joy), a fictional chess prodigy on her rise to the top of the chess world while struggling with
        drug and alcohol dependency.</p>
